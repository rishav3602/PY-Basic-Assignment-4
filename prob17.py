"""
17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
"""

"""
Answer...

copy.copy() creates just a reference of the original object and if we will make changes 
to the copied list the changes will also be made in the original file

deep.copy() creates a new object of the original file and if we will make changes to the
copied list the changes will not be made  in the original file
