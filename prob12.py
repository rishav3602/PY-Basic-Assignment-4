12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.

"""
Answer...

l = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
s = "Rishav"

There is a well defined syntax for a string and list in python.
Here l shows that it is a list cause it is written in big braces while s is a string as
it is written in double quotes.
If we will check the type of l and s will we get list and string respectively.


"""

l = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
s = "Rishav"
print(type(l))
print(type(s))
